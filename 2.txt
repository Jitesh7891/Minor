We applied PCA to the user-genre profile matrix, which represents how much each user prefers different genres.

Data Preparation (User-Genre Profile)

We first created a user-genre profile, where each user has a row, and each column represents their average rating for a specific genre.
This means each user is represented in a high-dimensional space (one dimension per genre).
Standardization

Since PCA is sensitive to scale, we standardized the data using StandardScaler().
Standardization ensures all features (genres) have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1, preventing any genre from dominating the analysis.
Applying PCA (Dimensionality Reduction)

We applied PCA to reduce the high-dimensional genre space into just two principal components (PC1 and PC2).
These two components capture the most significant patterns in user preferences, reducing noise and redundancy.
Projecting Users into PCA Space

Each user is now represented as a point in 2D space (PC1, PC2).
This allows us to visualize and compare users based on their overall genre preferences rather than individual genre ratings.
Finding Similar Users Using Euclidean Distance

We calculated Euclidean distances between users in this new PCA space.
The smaller the distance, the more similar their genre preferences are.
For each selected user, we found their top 5 nearest users (most similar in movie taste).
Generating Recommendations

We collected movie ratings from these similar users.
We excluded movies the target user has already rated.
We recommended the top 5 highest-rated movies from the similar users' ratings.
